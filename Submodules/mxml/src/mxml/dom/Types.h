/**
 In cases where text extends over more than one line, horizontal alignment and justify values can be different. The
 most typical case is for credits, such as:

     Words and music by
       Pat Songwriter

 Typically this type of credit is aligned to the right, so that the position information refers to the right-most part
 of the text. But in this example, the text is center-justified, not right-justified.

 The halign attribute is used in these situations. If it is not present, its value is the same as for the justify
 attribute.

 The tenths type is a number representing tenths of interline staff space (positive or negative). Both integer and

 the middle of a staff line.

 Distances in a MusicXML file are measured in tenths of staff space. Tenths are then scaled to millimeters within the
 scaling element, used in the defaults element at the start of a score. Individual staves can apply a scaling factor to
 adjust staff size. When a MusicXML element or attribute refers to tenths, it means the global tenths defined by the
 scaling element, not the local tenths as adjusted by the staff-size element.
