/**
 A tuplet element is present when a tuplet is to be displayed graphically, in addition to the sound data provided by
 the time-modification elements. The number attribute is used to distinguish nested tuplets. The bracket attribute is
 used to indicate the presence of a bracket. If unspecified, the results are implementation-dependent. The line-shape
 attribute is used to specify whether the bracket is straight or in the older curved or slurred style. It is straight
 by default.

 Whereas a time-modification element shows how the cumulative, sounding effect of tuplets and double-note tremolos
 compare to the written note type, the tuplet element describes how this is displayed. The tuplet element also provides
 more detailed representation information than the time-modification element, and is needed to represent nested tuplets
 and other complex tuplets accurately.

 The show-number attribute is used to display either the number of actual notes, the number of both actual and normal
 notes, or neither. It is actual by default. The show-type attribute is used to display either the actual type, both
 the actual and normal types, or neither. It is none by default.
