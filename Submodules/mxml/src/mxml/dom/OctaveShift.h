 The octave shift type indicates where notes are shifted up or down from their true pitched values because of
 printing difficulty. Thus a treble clef line noted with 8va will be indicated with an octave-shift down from the
 pitch data indicated in the notes. A size of 8 indicates one octave; a size of 15 indicates two octaves.
