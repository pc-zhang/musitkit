/**
 A system is a group of staves that are read and played simultaneously. System layout includes left and right margins
 and the vertical distance from the previous system. The system distance is measured from the bottom line of the
 previous system to the top line of the current system. It is ignored for the first system on a page. The top system
 distance is measured from the page's top margin to the top line of the first system. It is ignored for all but the
 first system on a page.

 Sometimes the sum of measure widths in a system may not equal the system width specified by the layout elements due to
 roundoff or other errors. The behavior when reading MusicXML files in these cases is application-dependent. For
 instance, applications may find that the system layout data is more reliable than the sum of the measure widths, and
 adjust the measure widths accordingly.
